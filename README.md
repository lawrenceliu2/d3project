## Team baseFunctionality

**Project:** Stuy diversity over time

Creating graphs and representing data of Stuyvesant studentsâ€™ races and ethnicities.

We will bring this data alive by drawing sets of bubbles representing the
frequency of each demographic group in a part of the school system--one set
for the whole DOE, one set for Stuyvesant, and sets for the boroughs. The
page will visualize these bubbles changing in size over time.

It will use dots to represent individual students, moving from the DOE-wide
bubbles to the Stuy-specific bubbles representing how many students are
admitted from each demographic group.
