Discussed our ideas with two groups:
- Oil inflows/outflows between nations interests
  some people a lot and others not at all.
- College admission rescindency rates would be
  very funny if we could get the dataset.
- The demographics of Stuy relative to the rest
  of the city is interesting and related to all of
  us, but difficult to "bring alive".

Added DOE demographic datasets to README.md and
described how we would present demographic data.
