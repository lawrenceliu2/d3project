Created devlog

wilsonB, chloeD -- 2017-03-27 8th pd.
Discussed our ideas with two groups:
- Oil inflows/outflows between nations interests
  some people a lot and others not at all.
- College admission rescindency rates would be
  very funny if we could get the dataset.
- The demographics of Stuy relative to the rest
  of the city is interesting and related to all of
  us, but difficult to "bring alive".

wilsonB -- 2017-03-27 22:00
Added DOE demographic datasets to README.md and
described how we would present demographic data.

fortuneS -- 2017-03-27 23:00
Drew some stuff of questionable accuracy.

lawrenceL -- 2017-03-28 22:00
Created basic files for Flask app, html, and js
Updated design doc

fortuneS -- 2017-03-28 23:00
Redrew data presentation
Minor contributions to design doc

chloeD -- 2017-03-28 23:30
Made the CSV files and decided on the format for the data 

fortuneS -- 2017-03-29 13:50
Added flavor text

chloeD -- 2017-03-29 14:05
Worked on the CSV file data inputs (there was no way to download the data or easily copy paste stuf, so a lot of data aka all of it was added manually) *SAD FACE*

chloeD -- 2017-03-29 22:05
Finished ALL the CSV data inputs!!! THANK GOODNESS :)
My next task is pretty simple: make python files/fxns to access data from the csv so that the flask app can call these fxns

chloeD -- 2017-03-30 14:05
Wrote out all the python functions in pseudo code

wilsonB -- 2017-03-31 13:45
Make initial D3 circle drawing, using random data

lawrenceL -- 2017-03-31 14:05
Opened issues on backend function returning lists and the need of a front end slider

fortuneS -- 2017-04-03 14:00
Added slider, attempted some styling

chloeD -- 2017-04-03 14:05
Wrote the first function in python

chloeD -- 2017-04-04 01:30
Wrote all the python functions... there is a bug and I'll fix it in class!

wilsonB -- 2017-04-04 14:00
Fall back on onchange event (on the slider) for browsers which don't
support oninput (oninput is preferable: it triggers as the user slides,
while onchange triggers when user releases slider).

fortuneS -- 2017-04-04 14:00
Changed slider value ranges to match data,
created second slider for overall population (has a different range),
changed/added data grouping.

chloeD -- 2017-04-04 14:05
Debugging but NEED TO FINISH :O

fortuneS -- 2017-04-04 23:50
additional styling in html, attempts at css show no results

wilsonB -- 2017-04-05 19:50
Make frontend rendering reflect the base functionality of our
original mockup: a row of bubbles for each school, and one for
the whole city, where each row has a bubble for each demographic
group.
