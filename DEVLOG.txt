Discussed our ideas with two groups:
- Oil inflows/outflows between nations interests
  some people a lot and others not at all.
- College admission rescindency rates would be
  very funny if we could get the dataset.
- The demographics of Stuy relative to the rest
  of the city is interesting and related to all of
  us, but difficult to "bring alive".
